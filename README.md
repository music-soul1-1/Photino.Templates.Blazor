## Photino & Blazor Pages template for Visual Studio

This is a template for creating a Photino application with Blazor Pages using Visual Studio.

Note for contributors:

After exporting the template, make sure to check `ReplaceParameters` property in the .vstemplate file. 
For example, for `_Imports.razor` this property is set to `false` by default, you need to manually set it to `true` in the .vstemplate file and then repack the zip.

Also, remove this README.md file from the template zip, as it is not needed in the final template.
